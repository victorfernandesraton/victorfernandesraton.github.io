Flexibility</h2><p class="text-sm font-semibold text-rosePine-foam">Published at <!--#-->2 months ago</p></header><article class="mx-auto max-w-[900px] article-custon-style"><h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-rosePine-iris">A big dsclaimer first</h1><p class="my-8 text"><img src="/assets/img/nulla-tools.webp" alt="image"></p><p class="my-8 text">Exploring the vast array of JavaScript frameworks such as React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte, I encountered limitations, vendor lock-in issues, and the overwhelming chaos of the JavaScript ecosystem, with its countless dependencies and conflicting solutions. However, amidst this tumult, my discovery of Nullstack brought a ray of hope. Initially seen as unconventional due to its use of ES6 classes and named methods for component cycles, I soon recognized the brilliance and potential of this framework.</p><p class="my-8 text">Nullstack stands out for its refreshing simplicity, offering streamlined data management through class props rather than convoluted states. One remarkable feature is its superior application context, which eliminates the need for a Redux store. Notably, Nullstack goes beyond the capabilities of Next.js by providing built-in support for progressive web app (PWA) capabilities without the need for additional dependencies, resulting in improved SEO capabilities.</p><p class="my-8 text">But the greatness of Nullstack extends further. It offers the flexibility to adapt to various application architectures, be it single-page applications (SPAs), static HTML, or Node servers with Express. What truly sets it apart is its lack of vendor lock-in, allowing projects to run seamlessly across diverse infrastructures, from on-premises to cloud-based environments. In a world rife with complexity and uncertainty, Nullstack emerges as a great solution, offering clarity and stability for web developers seeking an alternative path.</p><h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-rosePine-iris">Getting start</h1><p class="my-8 text">Nullstack is very consistent, because of this structure, everything in nullstack is based on things is were worked well along side the internet, isntead of create something like css module, for default nullstack support css and sass style.</p><p class="my-8 text">For create and manager your aplication, you don´t need handle with complex stuff like vite , webpack or babel, Nullstack have a npx tool to create application , with is have some things on a opitional support like tailwind, typescript and sass support, is a convension over configuration like </p><h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-rosePine-iris">First of all: Folder design</h1><p class="my-8 text">The first thing i start love in nullstack is about freedom, unlike next.js or angular you don´t have a definitive folder structure. According the documentation, the only thing you need is:</p><ul class="list-disc py-4 pl-4 marker:text-rosePine-iris"><li class="my-2">A client.js file witch is used for loading global client stuff, like added a global event or consume an browser api like Localstorage</li><li class="my-2">A server.js file witch is used for loading server side things like enviroment virables, connect an api or even write an http endpoint (because the second great thing about nullstack, in terms of runtime is a simple express server running in Node.js with is have all libs you are loved)</li><li class="my-2">A Application.js/jsx/njs file because is like React, a App.js file for initialize your application</li></ul><p class="my-8 text">this structure is result of building project using the only nad recomended way, nullstack-create-app cli, you can lean more about this <a  href="https://nullstack.app/getting-started" class="text-rosePine-rose underline underline-offset-2">in nullstack documentation</a></p><p class="my-8 text">for this project i use the command above</p><pre><code class="hljs language-bash">npx create-nullstack-app@latest project-name -tw
</code></pre><p class="my-8 text">Yep, i don´t use typescript in this project because seens like overrated for this....</p><p class="my-8 text">Now in project-name i can see a similar structure like this this structure</p><pre><code class="hljs language-txt">- src
-- Application.jsx
-- Application.css
-- Counter.jsx
-- Home.jsx
- server.js
- client.js
- tailwind.config.js
- tailwind.css
- package.json
</code></pre><p class="my-8 text">next them i added some changes in my tailwind config file for support rose-pine thene and my fonts </p><p class="my-8 text">for this project the first thing i do is added support or rose-pine colors (you can see my <a  href="https://github.com/victorfernandesraton/victorfernandesraton.github.io/blob/e8da50419b66dd70bca2b838186df9ca03b4e4ea/tailwind.config.js" class="text-rosePine-rose underline underline-offset-2">tailwind.config.js</a>)</p><p class="my-8 text">the second one is create the post structure, it&#39;s a simple and very stupid idea, i create a folder called posts, and added some markdowns file wittch i use the filename as a subpath in my blog section, so for create a simple post i added a post here</p><p class="my-8 text">the idea is using a node.js file systens functions to read this markdown and apply some styles using marked library (and some things is not work as well as you can see)</p><p class="my-8 text">the first implementation is your post component, because there we create to functions, one for get post and metadata for file and another to walk thorought the directory post and create a list of post, i mean content and metadata</p><p class="my-8 text">For access blog content you use /blog/some-post path, and they verify and get in /posts/some-post.md for contenrt</p><h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-rosePine-iris">Almost perfect</h1><p class="my-8 text">I know this is not performatic way to do this because of two things</p><ul class="list-disc py-4 pl-4 marker:text-rosePine-iris"><li class="my-2">The function for walking in directory is not optimized at all, also witch means we need iterate to every post and dcopllect every metadata and content like we do for show them, it&#39;s means , the scaklability of build time is incresead every time when i creating posts</li><li class="my-2">I need call all posts at once if i make this avaliable in SSG, because when i build one page, i need to call in prepare or initialize all posts and they not is performatic to show this list in to or many places</li></ul><p class="my-8 text">For you know about this , you need read Nullstack documentation about static and server side function, for now, you should know we create two server side GET functions, it&#39;s cool because since we move to SSR mode, nullstack generate a GET endpoint api for make requests, of course the path is a dibrish string , but if you need it&#39;s a very welll endpoint you should read more about server initialization in doc</p><p class="my-8 text">for now i wrote a simple post component, like this</p><pre><code class="hljs language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Nullstack</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;nullstack&#x27;</span>

# Hey guys!

My name is Victor Raton (some call me Baião), and I&#x27;m a Brazilian full-stack developer. When I&#x27;m not procrastinating or coming up with some side project that will be forgotten, I like to share my ideas here, covering topics such as web development, Linux, productivity, and even my hobbies, like playing metroidvanias or researching and customizing keyboards

I started studying software development in 2018, the same year I entered my first Computer Science degree. The following year, I began working as a full-stack developer, mostly with JavaScript.

I&#x27;ve decided to write more about technology in order to improve my skills.
