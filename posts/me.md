# Hey guys!

My name is Victor Raton (some call me Baião), and I'm a Brazilian full-stack developer. When I'm not procrastinating or coming up with some side project that will be forgotten, I like to share my ideas here, covering topics such as web development, Linux, productivity, and even my hobbies, like playing metroidvanias or researching and customizing keyboards.

I started studying software development in 2018, the same year I entered my first Computer Science degree. The following year, I began working as a full-stack developer, mostly with JavaScript.

I've decided to write more about technology in order to improve my skills.
